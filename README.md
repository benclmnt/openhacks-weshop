# WeShop

## Inspiration

Grocery shopping is a necessity, but due to current circumstances, it has become unsafe to subject the elderly and at-risk individuals to any kind of exposure, especially in high traffic areas such as grocery stores. Introducing WeShop, a web-based application that allows users to create individual shopping lists from a storeâ€™s catalog depending on distance and send them to a designated person to pick up. This application helps reduce the crowds at stores which are especially prevalent during COVID-19 and is an important step in containing national outbreaks.
